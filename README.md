# AI Endurance i18n

Localization files for AI Endurance.

If you would like to see your native language available in AI Endurance or notice a translation that could be improved, please send us a pull request! For new languages, we can provide an initial AI-generated translation from the English text and you can refine it from there. Reach out at info@aiendurance.com if you want us to set up a new language for you.

Please note that you cannot add new keys or rename existing keys. Only modify the values/translations. We need to add new keys to all files simultaneously and make corresponding changes to the codebase. Also, please do not re-order keys as this makes it difficult to track what has actually changed.
