        "description": "AI Endurance is the only truly Artificial Intelligence-powered training platform out there. We don't adapt predefined training plans for our athletes. Our platform is incredibly individualized for each athlete that uses it, learning your physiology on a very deep level. We take into account things like how quickly you recover, which types of intervals you respond best to, and your specific goals to create plans that are uniquely crafted for your body and your goals."

If not it's because it either doesn't work, or they don't know and don't care for a scientific and data-driven approach. Don't waste your valuable training time with a plan that is based on someone's opinion without taking all your data into account. We know AI Endurance works because not only have we compared it to the most recent peer-reviewed research in exercise physiology, we have shown how our AI optimized training easily outperforms even the best one-size-fits-all approach current research has to offer.",
