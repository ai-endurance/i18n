            "text": "Hi, I'm Markus - the founder of AI Endurance and a passionate triathlete (2:06 Olympic distance, 4:34 Half-Ironman), runner and cyclist myself. I'm also a particle physicist, who worked at world leading institutions such as University of Oxford. Ever since I started working with machine learning methods in my physics research, I've been wondering how to leverage these methods to come up with a more data-driven, more predictive and optimized training routine. This is what AI Endurance is about: utilizing the great potential of machine learning and the big data we are collecting everyday in our training to address the challenge of selecting the 'right' training for every athlete with their very individual response to training.",
