For example, if you're running up a steep hill your raw pace might be slow but your GAP can be high as it takes the steepness of the hill into account. By normalizing the pace based on these elevation changes, it provides a more accurate reflection of the effort exerted over varying terrain, making it a useful metric for comparing performances across different routes or understanding the impact of hills on your overall pace."
